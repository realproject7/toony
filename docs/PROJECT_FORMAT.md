## `webtoon.json`

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "projectId": "my-webtoon",
  "title": "My Webtoon",
  "referenceWidth": 800,
  "languages": {
    "defaultLanguage": "en",
    "supportedLanguages": ["en"],
    "dialogueLanguage": "en",
    "promptLanguage": "en"
  },
  "imageProviders": {
    "defaultProvider": "manual",
    "providers": []
  }
}
```

`referenceWidth` is the reading column, in px, the project's vertical
measurements are written against. A transition's `gutterHeight` is a length on
that column, and an export at any other width scales it by the ratio, so the
episode reads the same at every resolution. Optional: a project without it
declares the 800px standard canvas the spacing vocabulary is calibrated to.

## Canonical Episode Sequence

Cuts and transitions must appear in reader order.

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
id: ep-001
title: Episode 1
sequence:
  - type: cut
    id: cut-001
  - type: transition
    id: tr-001
  - type: cut
    id: cut-002
```
